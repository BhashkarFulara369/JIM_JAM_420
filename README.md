# NASA space app challenge 2024 team JIM JAM 420
## The challenge
Our challenge is to develop a scalable tool that can generate informative and compelling visualizations of biological experiments performed in space, including two experiments conducted on the International Space Station—the Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (OSD-379) and the Rodent Research-23 mission (OSD-665). Think about how your tool can create visualizations that capture the “essence” of these experiments and allow scientists to quickly understand the structure of the data.
